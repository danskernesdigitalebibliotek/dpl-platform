# DPL Admin - scripts for supporting the day-to-day operations

This directory contains a set of scripts that can automate various operational
procedures.

The use of this tool is documented in the various [runbooks](../../documentation/runbooks)
that has to do with the deployment and configuration of sites.

While the scripts can be invoked directly, they should generally be invoked
via [task](../Taskfile.yml).
