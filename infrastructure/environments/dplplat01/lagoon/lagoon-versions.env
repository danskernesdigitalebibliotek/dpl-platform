# Get Lagoon versions from the Chart.yml - inspect appVersion to determine which
# version of lagoon is installed

# Current appVersion for remote and core is v2.15.0
# https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-charts/blob/main/charts/lagoon-core/Chart.yaml#L20
VERSION_LAGOON_CORE=1.29.0
# https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-charts/blob/main/charts/lagoon-remote/Chart.yaml#L21
VERSION_LAGOON_REMOTE=0.77.0

# This should match the currently installed version of Lagoon Remote. It
# actually maps to an image tag here: https://hub.docker.com/r/uselagoon/kubectl-build-deploy-dind/tags
# See https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-charts/releases/tag/lagoon-core-1.2.0
#
# Note for Lagoon v2.10.0 - it did not have a matching build image, so staying
# with the latest (v2.9.2).
# https://hub.docker.com/r/uselagoon/kubectl-build-deploy-dind/tags
# Rumors will have it that this thing is no longer used or at the very least
# will be deprecated soon. We should keep an eye on what happens in the future
# releases of lagoon-remote.
